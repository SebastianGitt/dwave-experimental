features:
  - |
    Improve the performance of the automorphism submodule by using an optimized
    color refinement algorithm, doing more efficient pruning using existing
    automorphisms without changing the base, and by comparing graphs by their
    refinement history instead of their adjacency matrix. Additionally, graphs
    with disjoint components are handled more efficiently by determining if
    components are isomorphic and explicitly handling "swap" automorphisms
    between components.
  - |
    Add support for returning a mapping to the original graph labels, as well
    as vertex and edge orbits expressed in the original graph labels.
fixes:
  - |
    Fix a bug where generators could be missed if coset representatives could
    belong to multiple left transversals, potentially undercounting the number
    of automorphisms for certain types of graphs.
